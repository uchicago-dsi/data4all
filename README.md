This repository contains the curricular materials to teach the Data4All High School Bridge Workshop. The workshop has been developed and taught twice a year since spring 2021 at the University of Chicago’s <a href="https://datascience.uchicago.edu/">Data Science Institute</a> (DSI), in collaboration with the [Center for Spatial Data Science](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/education/scientific-reasoning) (CSDS), [Argonne National Labs](https://www.anl.gov/education) (ANL), and the [Office of Civic Engagement](https://civicengagement.uchicago.edu/) (OCE). 

The goal of Data4All is to teach high school students how to use computation, statistics, and mapping to address real-world data problems. This focus on reasoning with data seeks to broaden students’ understanding of what data science (DS) is, beyond a more narrow technical focus on programming and statistics. It is also intended to highlight the relevance of DS to a broad variety of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields and other disciplines, including college and career options students did not  associate with DS before. 

The main documents that summarize the workshop and the related materials are the [instructor guide](https://github.com/uchicago-dsi/data4all/blob/published/Documents/Data_4_All_Instructor_Guide%20Sept%2024%202024.pdf) and the [workshop schedule](https://github.com/uchicago-dsi/data4all/blob/published/Documents/Schedule.xlsx).
